## 3. What is ERC20 token?

'ERC' stands for "Ethereum Request for Comments‚Äù. This is an official protocol for proposing improvements to the Ethereum network. '20' is the unique proposal ID number.

'ERC20' is actually a standard that tokens on the Ethereum network can meet and tokens that check all the necessary boxes are deemed 'ERC20 Tokens'.
These tokens are blockchain assets that have value and can be sent and received like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dash, Ethereum or any other cryptocurrency.
The difference between these tokens and a standalone currency like Bitcoin is that ERC20 tokens rely on the Ethereum network hosted by Ethereum addresses and sent by Ethereum transactions.

All ERC20 tokens transact on the same network that your Ethereum wallet uses. Hence an CPC address is also a GNT address is also an EOS address and so forth.
